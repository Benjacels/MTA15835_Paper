\section{Experiment}

To investigate the effects of riddle-solving as the navigation method in a location-based game, we conducted a comparative study between navigating by riddle-solving and navigating by a 2D map with GPS. The experiment took place over two weekends in central Aalborg, Denmark. Participants used an iPad 2 3G + WiFi as the platform.

\subsubsection{Hypothesis}

We hypothesized that \textit{riddles as navigational method are more enjoyable than maps.} We came up with the following null hypothesis and its alternative hypothesis.

\textbf{H0:} Riddles as navigational method are equal or less enjoyable than maps. 

\hspace{10 mm} \textit{H0: $\mu$EnjoyabilityRiddle $\leq$ $\mu$EnjoyabilityMap}

\textbf{H1:} Riddles as navigational method are more enjoyable than maps.

\hspace{10 mm} \textit{H1: $\mu$EnjoyabilityRiddle $>$ $\mu$EnjoyabilityMap}

\subsubsection{Participants}

Our initial target group was originally meant to be tourists, but we chose to recruit families from Aalborg or nearby in order to gain as many participants as possible. We recruited 10 numbers of 2-6 person families through posters and flyers at schools. 
As the narrative of the game was targeted children, it was a requirement that the families had at least one child in the age range 9-11 year. 17 children participated with ages ranging between the age of 7 and 13 (mean = 10.1, SD = 1.6), 9 females and 8 males. 14 adults participated with ages ranging between the age of 36 and 62 (mean = 42.3, SD = 6.4), 4 females and 10 males.  All participants lived in the city or nearby, and was familiar with the city Aalborg (4 went to the city daily, 5 went to the city weekly, 18 went to the city monthly, 4 went to the city yearly). All participants were familiar using tablet or mobile devices (23 used it daily, 6 used it weekly, 1 used it monthly, 1 used it yearly).


\subsubsection{Materials and Procedure}
The experiment was designed as a within-subjects design with two conditions. (1) A navigational method, where the participants navigated by solving riddles (R) and (2) A navigational method in which the participants used a digital map (M).

These two conditions were counterbalanced with the purpose of reducing the environmental effects met on the route on the results. Participants would either begin with map or riddles, and would end with the navigational method different from the one met in the beginning. 

Three street arts, A, B and C, were a part of the experience. The distance from A to B was 0,9 km and the distance from B to C was 0,9 km. Each condition also had approximately same amount of turns, respectively 8 and 7 turns. Each session lasted between xx min to xx min. One facilitator and one observer would be present during the whole session. The facilitator would explain the participants in using the application before beginning the game, and further help during the game if any difficulties would arise (e.g. participants getting lost). Parents were instructed to wear a GoPro with harness and a bluetooth microphone for recording video and audio. All parents signed consent forms and filled out demographic questionnaires prior to the experience. We gave the child in the age range 9-11 the ipad, but they were not forced to handle it the whole session. 

LBGs have previously been evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative methods including observational studies, questionnaires and interviews. Morrison et. al. used Flow(kilde), Instrinsic Movation (IMI) [6] and Presence - MEC-SPQ [12] questionnaires and successfully evaluated effects such as enjoyability, motivation and awareness of surroundings by triangulating with video recordings, logs, field notes and transcriptions of interview data. We used the same approach, based on the success of Morrison et al. investigating similar criteria as our study. 

The questionnaire in this study contains questions from the Short Flow State Scale Questionnaire (S-FSS 2), which measures the degree to which flow dimensions characterize the
completed experience. The questionnaire also contains questions from IMI (measures enjoyability, tension, effort and perceived competence) and MEC-SPQ (measures spatial presence, allocated attention and Suspension of Disbelief). Only adults received this questionnaire due to the level of complexity, while children received a simplified questionnaire measuring enjoyability using IMI. Both questionnaires were measured on a likert scale (5-scale), going from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The parents were instructed to help the children to fill out the questionnaire in terms of them having difficulties. 
 
\section{Results}

\subsection{Questionnaires}
We used the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, based on the nature of ordinal values and due to the sample had been exposed to two conditions (riddle solving and map).

All participants found the system using Riddles significantly more intrinsic motivating (IMI) than maps(See Table \ref{my-label1}). Assessing IMI, we found that enjoyability and effort scored significantly higher for Riddles compared to Maps. Riddles also received a significantly higher score than Maps concerning total Flow. No significant difference was found for Presence, but Riddles was still favoured in terms of its score.

\end{table}

We found significant differences when assessing individual questions from the questionnaire (See Table \ref{my-label}). All participants especially found the Riddle system significantly more fun and less boring compared to the map version. We observed that riddles served a potential of including multiple family members, which  accommodate the fact that all participants had a enjoyable experience. 

Adults found the riddles significantly more rewarding and had the feeling of the time moving faster compared to the map version. These two questions specifically assesses the dimension on having an autotellic experience and the sense of time transformation. As flow involves nine dimensions, these two were the only dimensions to reveal a significantly difference. Other dimensions of flow favoured Riddles, or was closely tied with Maps (0.05 score difference between R and M), except for a flow question revolving on clear goals. Our questionnaire revealed that test participants found the Map system had more clear goals (R =3.31, M =3.83, p=.174). As the result is not significant, it is however observed that the Map did not require much training, and henceforth more intuitive than what we observed with the Riddle system. However, participants still favoured the Riddle system despite these difficulties. 

Children thought they were significantly better navigating with Riddles, rather than using a maps. We found that children considered maps more challenging from the questionnaire which could provide an explanation on the matter, but this was not founded significant (R =2.82, M =3.33, p=.177).
 
We performed an multiple ordinal regression analysis on the questions from Table \ref{my-label}, whether age, gender, condition order or group size served as predictors for the results. In all cases, the results stayed significant, but the condition order was revealed to have a significant impact on several of the questions concerning IMI. 

Due to the condition order, the selection of Riddles were different, as well as the route described on the Map. Different attractions on the route would be met differently based on the condition order, and eventually provide a different experience.

We can reject our null hypothesis, stating that riddles as navigational method are more enjoyable than maps.
