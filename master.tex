\begin{abstract}
Mobile location-based games are experiences that entertain its players by requiring interactions mainly at points of interest (POIs). Navigation between POIs often involve the use of either a physical or digital map, not taking advantage of the opportunity available to engage users in activities between POIs. The present paper examines, how riddle-solving as a navigational method in a family location-based game experience affects enjoyability, compared to a 2D digital map. 10 families with 2-6 persons and at least one child in the age range 9-11 years old participated in the evaluation of a location-based game experience called \textit{Lost on Earth}. Statistical evidence that riddle-solving as a navigational method is more enjoyable than a 2D digital map was found using questionnaires. Findings from video recordings, field notes, questionnaires, logging and semi-structured interviews also revealed that riddle-solving as navigational method in mobile location-based games has potential in engaging users in learning activities.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:

% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
