\subsection{Navigation in Location-based Games}
Location based games (LBG's) utilizes specific locations in their gameplay, which brings up the requirement of navigating between locations. Walking between locations will bring up opportunities to gain additional knowledge of the city, and not solely at specific locations (e.g. point of interests). This potential of getting familiar with the city while walking may not be fully utilized, since navigation can be a demanding task when being in unfamiliar settings. The potential in getting familiar with the city while walking may not be fully utilized, since LBG's often revolve on specific locations rather on what is between. Previous studies revolving around the navigational aspect within LBG’s is limited. 
Gordillo et al made a location based game encouraging learning in the city for tourism\cite{Learninggamified}. The game offered three points of interests which were marked on a 2D map, requiring the participant to go there in order to trigger activities provided at the location.  One distance required travelling 3 km (from Güell Park to Casa Batlló), bringing the game to pause until arrival at the point of interest.  The outcome of the study is unknown, due to no test was carried out.  From this we observe, that the navigational served minimal priority, but merely serves as a requirement for leading the player from a point of interest (POI) to another. 

Several LBG's have used 2D maps with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology (e.g. google maps) in city related context, in order to guide their participants to the points of interest \cite{TheoreticalAndMethod, Learninggamified, knowcity, Carrigy:2010:DEP:1868914.1868929, GamingTourism, Procyk:2013:GLG:2468356.2468550, Bell:2009:ESN:1518701.1518723}. 2D maps are non-coherent to the rest of the gameplay, and continuously disrupts the game experience. The 2D map does not promote any interplay between the physical and virtual domain, and game mechanics (e.g. getting points, puzzles) either disappears serves no purpose until arrival to next location.  To the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated or evaluated whether navigating with a 2D map is preferable in the context of location based games. 

We have investigated use of navigation in several LBG's, in terms of the interplay between the physical and virtual domain, extent of ludic and pedagogic elements and whether it is supported by a narrative. Some LBGs revolves on progressing a story. These types of games depend on sound, and do not depend on visuals for navigating (e.g. Blyte et al.) Events offered in these games are triggered based on how the player choose, to navigate, giving navigation a crucial role in the overall experience.

A qualitative study made by Blythe et al. investigated the enjoyability of a location based game revolving on progressing a story\cite{InterdisciplinaryCriticism}. The participants navigated freely in a restricted area, and the story changed dynamically in relation to their location. In interviews the participants stated that they found the experience enjoyable in relation of them having control of the story. The game highly promoted interplay between the physical and virtual domain, but its design may only be appropriate in a small bounded area due to the extended freedom of exploration, and could be problematic if transferred to a wider context (e.g. a city) due to longer distances between POIs. Epstein and Vergani made a similar study on a walking tour in the city Venice, which likewise incorporated the narrative space into the navigation, but instead kept a more linear narrative structure \cite{MobileTechnologies}. A narrator in the application verbally explained where to make turns, and in the same time made comments on the physical environment. The outcome of the study did not reveal the users experience concerning the navigation.

Both Blythe et al. and Epstein and Vergani encourage the user in exploring, but only in relation to the person handling the application. Our context deals with tourist families, which would require sharing information. Utilizing audio without it being communicated through headphones would be problematic in terms of navigating in areas with many sounds. 

Eguma et al. devised a location based game for tourists utilizing a sightseeing navigation system to promote awareness of surroundings and enjoyability\cite{HideAndSeek}.  The authors proposed creating a navigational system using augmented reality (AR) to display descriptive information from air tags, and upon arrival the participants would have to seek out a character in the surroundings. The concept do however make use of a map, in terms of leading the participants to the area requiring AR for navigating.  The aim of the system was letting the user become aware of the surroundings, using “benefit of inconvenience”, which proposes the idea of something being inconvenient to find increases the desire of finding it. The authors did not conduct a study, therefor the outcome is unknown.

Utilizing AR combined with physical props has served as the navigational method in some location based games. Morrison et al. conducted a comparative study on a technique called Maplens involving displaying location information on a physical map using augmented reality, comparing it to a 2D map with incorporated accessibility to read about locations, known as DigiMap \cite{Morrison}. This technique was investigated in relation to Flow, Presence and Intrinsic Motivation (IMI). The MapLens scored significantly less than DigiMap in most of the questions concerning Flow, Presence and IMI, but its potential was revealed in terms of social interaction since the MapLens encouraged collaborative behavior.  Morrison et al. found that MapLens did not support ‘playing by moving’, due to its demands of effort, forethought and planning. This behavior is supported by the study made by Kuikkaniemi et al., which compared MapLens and navigating by following QR codes \cite{LostLab}. The authors did not find MapLens particularly useful based on observations on the participants. The authors observed that the participants rarely used MapLens, and had technical difficulties in terms of the GPS displaying their correct position. The QR codes were a fun way of navigating both indoors and outdoors, based on non-significant observations, but with no concrete examples on why. The QR codes did not promote any environmental awareness, making the interplay between the physical and virtual domain weak. 

Previous research show a tendency integrating 2D maps with GPS into location based games, but whether this method is preferable in a game context, is to our best knowledge unknown.  The demands for a location based game lies in the necessity of a strong interplay between the physical and virtual domain, containing ludic and pedagogic elements and is supported by a narrative.  To our best knowledge, no location based game makes use of all these factors into their navigational method, making the navigation seem less prioritized.
