\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we investigated the effects of riddle solving as a navigational method in a location-based game experience for families. We compared this navigational method with a 2D map, which is a common navigational method to get from one POI to another in location-based games. We found significant results indicating that riddle-solving as a navigational method is more enjoyable than a 2D map. Though perhaps not being a more intuitive navigational method than 2D maps, riddle-solving clearly suits the scope of location-based game experiences, as it makes use of the physical space to navigate from one POI to another, while also adding more enjoyment to the experience. We recommend looking into using this or similar approaches to create not only enjoyable, but also educational experiences.
